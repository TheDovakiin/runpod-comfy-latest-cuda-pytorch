## Quick Start

### On RunPod

1. Use this Docker image: `kgabeci/runpod-comfy-latest:latest`
2. Set port mapping: `8188:8188,8888:8888`
3. ComfyUI will be available at `http://[your-pod-ip]:8188`
4. JupyterLab will be available at `http://[your-pod-ip]:8888`

### Local Development

```bash
docker build -t runpod-comfy-latest .
docker run -p 8188:8188 -p 8888:8888 -v ./workspace:/workspace runpod-comfy-latest
```

## System Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.8+ support
- Driver version 555+ (for data center GPUs, 470.57+ may work)
- At least 8GB GPU memory recommended

## Technical Details

- **Base Image**: `pytorch/pytorch:2.7.1-cuda12.8-cudnn9-runtime`
- **Python**: 3.10 (from base image)
- **CUDA**: 12.8
- **cuDNN**: 9
- **ComfyUI**: Latest from main branch
- **ComfyUI-Manager**: Latest from main branch

## First Run Setup

The container automatically:

1. **Copies pre-installed ComfyUI** to network storage (no downloads!)
2. **Creates helper scripts** for easy management
3. **Ready to use immediately** - no waiting for dependency installations

### Enhanced Terminal Features

- **Tab completion** for commands and files
- **Colored prompt** showing current directory
- **Useful aliases**: `ll`, `la`, `l` for better file listing
- **Pre-installed utilities**: htop, tree, tmux, screen, vim, zip/unzip

## Helper Scripts

After first run, you'll find these scripts in `/workspace`:

- `run_gpu.sh` - Start ComfyUI with GPU acceleration
- `run_cpu.sh` - Start ComfyUI in CPU-only mode
- `update_comfyui.sh` - Update ComfyUI and ComfyUI-Manager to latest versions
- `start_jupyter.sh` - Start JupyterLab on port 8888

## Port Configuration

- **8188**: ComfyUI web interface
- **8888**: JupyterLab interface (no password required)

## Volume Mapping

Mount `/workspace` to persist your ComfyUI installation, models, and outputs across container restarts.
